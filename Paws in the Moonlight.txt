Paws in the Moonlight

Under the moon’s soft silver glow,
My little cat moves calm and slow.
With quiet steps and gentle eyes,
He wanders where the starlight lies.

He settles near me, warm and still,
A quiet guardian by pure will.
And when the world feels rough or wrong,
His tender purr becomes my calm.

He curls beside me, soft and small,
A silent guardian through it all.
And when the world feels loud or long,
His gentle purr becomes my song.
