Paws in the Moonlight: My Comfort in the Night

Under the moon’s soft silver glow,
My little cat moves calm and slow.
With quiet steps and gentle eyes,
He wanders where the starlight lies.

He settles near me, warm and still,
A quiet guardian by pure will.
And when the world feels rough or wrong,
His tender purr becomes my calm.

He curls beside me, calm and near,
A quiet friend who brings me cheer.
And when the world feels harsh or long,
His gentle purr becomes my song.

And as the daylight starts to creep,
He stretches from his cozy sleep.
No magic — just his quiet way
Of making peace begin my day.
