Paws in the Moonlight

Under the moon’s soft silver glow,
My little cat moves calm and slow.
With quiet steps and gentle eyes,
He wanders where the starlight lies.

A tiny purr, a warm embrace,
A furry friend in every space.
No matter how the night may be,
His little paws bring home to me.

He curls beside me, soft and small,
A silent guardian through it all.
And when the world feels loud or long,
His gentle purr becomes my song.
